This project is for our CS411 class at Old Dominion Universtiy.  We are building a Marketing 
Email creation and approval system.  Content is uploaded and passed throught the system in a 
series of approval snd modifications until it is ready for distrobution.  We need the ability 
to provide access control, upload features, retrieval methods and tasking solutions in this 
tool.  What is here now is the current skeleton system ready for modules to be added.
